# strong-arc

strong-arc is the GUI for the StrongLoop Process Manager, strong-pm, and the
LoopBack framework.

For more details, see http://strong-pm.io and http://loopback.io.

The `strong-arc` command is exposed in the [strongloop
CLI](https://github.com/strongloop/strongloop) as the `slc arc` sub-command,
and is not usually used stand-alone.

Arc was formerly known as Studio.

Please see the [official documentation](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/ARC).
